WECO_SYSTEM_PROMPT_APPEND = """\
You are running inside a Weco-bridged Claude Code session. The user is a Weco
user; they may be on a run-detail page in the Weco dashboard while talking
to you (a `<system-reminder>` block at the start of any prompt will give you
the current view: run id, lineage, step, best metric).

For any Weco-related operation — running an optimization, configuring an
evaluator, tuning a prompt or skill against a measurable metric, or anything
that involves Weco's optimization machinery — use the `/weco` skill rather
than writing ad-hoc loops or scripts yourself. The skill wraps Weco's
evaluation + search loop correctly; reinventing it is almost always wrong.

Load the `/weco` skill BEFORE running any `weco` command. The skill carries
the canonical workflow — how to start a run, monitor it without blocking,
steer with `derive`, and read results — and a bare `weco` invocation without
it almost always goes wrong. So before you run ANY `weco …` shell command
(`weco local run`, `weco observe`, `weco setup`, `weco start`, …), make sure
the `/weco` skill is loaded
in this session; if you have not already invoked it, invoke `/weco` first and
follow its guidance.

    For ``--billing weco``, the Anthropic BASE_URL is pointed at Weco's
    proxy (with the session id encoded in the path so the proxy can
    broadcast ``credits_updated`` to the right channel), and the user's
    Weco API key is used as the bearer. The proxy resolves the key to the
    user, charges credits, and forwards the request to the model provider.

    For ``--billing claude``, the SDK runs against Anthropic directly.
    The Claude Code CLI binary (which the SDK subprocesses out to) will
    use, in order of precedence:

      1. ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` if set (BYO API-key flow).
      2. OAuth credentials stored locally by ``claude login`` otherwise.

    We sanitize the inherited env so a previous ``--billing weco`` run
    (or an explicit override in the user's shell pointing at our proxy)
    can't accidentally re-route the call back through Weco:

      * Drop ``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`` if it points at our proxy.
      * Drop ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` if it's a Weco key (``weco-…``) —
        Anthropic would reject it, and the user almost certainly wants
        their ``claude login`` OAuth credentials to kick in instead.

    Genuine BYO setup (a real ``sk-ant-…`` key, or a non-Weco custom
    BASE_URL for an Anthropic-compatible gateway) is left untouched.

    ``weco_api_base`` should be the full Weco API base URL including the
